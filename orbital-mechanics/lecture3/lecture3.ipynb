    "### Deriving The Eccentricity Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eccentricity vector $\\vec{e}$ helps us describe the shape of an orbit and its direction. We can find it by taking the cross product of the velocity and the specific angular momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\ddot{\\vec{r}} = - \\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\vec{r}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Taking the cross product with the specific angular momentum, $\\vec{h}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\ddot{\\vec{r}}\\times\\vec{h} = \\textcolor{red}{- \\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\vec{r}}\\times\\vec{h}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Using the rule for $\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\times{c}=(\\vec{c}\\cdot\\vec{a})\\vec{b}-(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{a})\\vec{c}$ with $\\vec{h}=\\vec{r}\\cdot\\dot{\\vec{r}}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}[(\\dot{\\vec{r}}\\cdot\\vec{r})\\vec{r}-(\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r})\\dot{\\vec{r}}]\\rightarrow-\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}(\\dot{r}r\\vec{r}-r^2\\dot{\\vec{r}})\\rightarrow-\\frac{\\mu}{r^2}(\\dot{r}\\vec{r}-r\\dot{\\vec{r}})\\\\\\Rightarrow =\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mu\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Rightarrow \\dot{\\vec{r}}\\times\\vec{h} - \\mu\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r} = constant\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Which can be rewritten as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\bf{\\vec{e}=\\frac{\\dot{\\vec{r}}\\times\\vec{h}}{\\mu}-\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This is our equation for the eccentricity vector!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first integrals of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $\\vec{e}$ is a constant vector, implying both constant direction and magnitude.\n",
    "   - $\\vec{e}$ lies in the plane of motion and is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let's define:\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   \\textbf{e} = \\frac{\\vec{e}}{\\mu}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $e$ is the eccentricity.\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\vec{e}$ lies in the plane of motion and (since it is constant) has a fixed magnitude and direction.\n",
    "   $\\Rightarrow \\hat{i}\\equiv\\vec{e}$, so we can use the eccentricity as one of the axes.\n",
    "* The eccentricity, $e=|\\vec{e}| \\geq 0$, determines the shape of the orbit:\n",
    "   - $e = 0$: Circular orbit\n",
    "   - $0 < e < 1$: Elliptic orbit\n",
    "   - $e = 1$: Parabolic orbit\n",
    "   - $e > 1$: Hyperbolic orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equation of the Orbit\n",
    "If we look at the dot product of $\\vec{e}\\cdot\\vec{r}$ we know that:\n",
    "$\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{e}=recos\\theta$ and if we recall $\\vec{a}\\cdot(\\vec{b}\\times\\vec{c})=(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})\\cdot\\vec{c}$ then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\vec{r}\\cdot(\\dot{\\vec{r}}\\times\\dot{\\vec{h}})}{\\mu}-\\frac{\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r}}{r}=\\frac{(\\vec{r}\\times\\dot{\\vec{r}})\\cdot\\vec{h}}{\\mu} - \\frac{r^2}{r} = \\frac{h^2}{\\mu}-r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So then this equivalence implies:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{\\frac{h^2}{\\mu}}{1+ecos\\theta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $\\theta$ is called the true anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another way of expressing **Kepler's 1st Law** - the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the two focii. This is an **Equation of the Orbit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: $\\theta$ can also be expressed as $v$ or $f$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   r describes the shape of the orbits as conic sections through the varying eccentricities shown before but it is important to note that:\n",
    "   * Operative orbits are always circular or elliptic. As these keep the satellite closest to the planet of interest for as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hyperbolic orbits are maneuvers used on interplanetary missions to reduce propellant use by using the gravity of a body to reach another target body.\n",
