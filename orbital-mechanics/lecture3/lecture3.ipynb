    "\n",
    "The Eccentricity vector $\\mathbf{e}$ helps us describe the shape of an orbit and its direction. We can find it by taking the cross product of the velocity and the specific angular momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = - \\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Taking the cross product with the specific angular momentum, $\\mathbf{h}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}\\times\\mathbf{h} = \\textcolor{red}{- \\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}}\\times\\mathbf{h}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Using the rule for $\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}\\times{c}=(\\mathbf{c}\\cdot\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{b}-(\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{c}$ with $\\mathbf{h}=\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}[(\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{r}-(\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}]\\rightarrow-\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}(\\dot{r}r\\mathbf{r}-r^2\\dot{\\mathbf{r}})\\rightarrow-\\frac{\\mu}{r^2}(\\dot{r}\\mathbf{r}-r\\dot{\\mathbf{r}})\\\\\\Rightarrow =\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mu\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   This gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Rightarrow \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\times\\mathbf{h} - \\mu\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r} = constant\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Which can be rewritten as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathbf{\\mathbf{e}=\\frac{\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\times\\mathbf{h}}{\\mu}-\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This is our equation for the eccentricity vector!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first integrals of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{e}$ is a constant vector, implying both constant direction and magnitude.\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{e}$ lies in the plane of motion and is fixed.\n",

    "   Let's define:\n",

    "   \\textbf{e} = \\frac{\\mathbf{e}}{\\mu}\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{e}$ lies in the plane of motion and (since it is constant) has a fixed magnitude and direction.\n",
    "   $\\Rightarrow \\hat{i}\\equiv\\mathbf{e}$, so we can use the eccentricity as one of the axes.\n",
    "* The eccentricity, $e=|\\mathbf{e}| \\geq 0$, determines the shape of the orbit:\n",
    "   - $e = 0$: Circular orbit\n",
    "   - $0 < e < 1$: Elliptic orbit\n",
    "   - $e = 1$: Parabolic orbit\n",
    "   - $e > 1$: Hyperbolic orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equation of the Orbit\n",
    "If we look at the dot product of $\\mathbf{e}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}$ we know that:\n",
    "$\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{e}=recos\\theta$ and if we recall $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot(\\mathbf{b}\\times\\mathbf{c})=(\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b})\\cdot\\mathbf{c}$ then:\n",

    "\\frac{\\mathbf{r}\\cdot(\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{h}})}{\\mu}-\\frac{\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}{r}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r}\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{r}})\\cdot\\mathbf{h}}{\\mu} - \\frac{r^2}{r} = \\frac{h^2}{\\mu}-r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So then this equivalence implies:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{\\frac{h^2}{\\mu}}{1+ecos\\theta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $\\theta$ is called the true anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another way of expressing **Kepler's 1st Law** - the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the two focii. This is an **Equation of the Orbit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: $\\theta$ can also be expressed as $v$ or $f$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   r describes the shape of the orbits as conic sections through the varying eccentricities shown before but it is important to note that:\n",
    "   * Operative orbits are always circular or elliptic. As these keep the satellite closest to the planet of interest for as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hyperbolic orbits are maneuvers used on interplanetary missions to reduce propellant use by using the gravity of a body to reach another target body.\n",
